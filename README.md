# This is my first website

## About:
Not much to say, lots of links to wikipedia pages.
All of which are going to be useful during the training at hand.

## Consists of:
Several html pages, linking back to each other using a simple menu.
Styling of the page is done through CSS, images used are linked from other sites (for now).

Over time, I'm fairly sure I'll be revisiting this site, and either add on to it, or fiddle about with settings.
